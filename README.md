# AMFOSS-TASKS


# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aaryan

I'm currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. I'm someone who enjoys solving problems through code, learning new technologies, and collaborating with like-minded individuals.

## Why should you choose me?

Iâ€™m consistent, curious, and willing to put in the effort to learn and grow. I may not know everything right now, but Iâ€™m comfortable starting from scratch and committed to improving over time. I enjoy figuring things out, and Iâ€™m not afraid to ask for help or put in extra hours when needed.

## How do I intend to contribute back to the club?

If given the opportunity, Iâ€™d like to actively contribute to projects, help with tasks wherever possible, and be a reliable team member. I believe in learning by doing, and Iâ€™m excited to participate in activities, discussions, and collaborative work that benefits both the club and its members.

## Fields of Interest & Plans

### Web Development  
I'm currently exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My short-term goal is to get comfortable building frontend applications and gradually understand how backend systems work.

### Open Source  
Iâ€™m new to open source, but Iâ€™m eager to get involved. My plan is to start smallâ€”understanding codebases, fixing minor issues, and gradually contributing more meaningfully as I learn.

### Problem Solving  
I enjoy solving problems and aim to improve my skills through regular practice on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces, while building a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.

Looking forward to being a part of amFOSS and learning alongside the community.
