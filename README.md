# AMFOSS-TASKS


Hello 👋 I’m Aaryan

I’m currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. I enjoy solving problems with code, learning new technologies, and collaborating with people who share the same passion.

🌟 Why me?

Consistent & Curious – I like to show up every day and keep learning.

Growth mindset – I may not know everything yet, but I’m comfortable starting from scratch and improving step by step.

Reliable – I don’t shy away from putting in the extra effort when the team needs it.

🤝 How I’d Contribute

I want to actively take part in projects, be a dependable teammate, and contribute wherever I can—whether that’s writing code, solving issues, or simply helping others. I believe learning by doing is the best way forward, and I’d love to grow alongside the community while giving back to it.

🔭 Fields of Interest

🌐 Web Development

Currently exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My short-term goal is to build solid frontend applications and gradually dive deeper into backend systems.

🐧 Open Source

Still new, but eager to start with small contributions like understanding codebases and fixing minor issues, and gradually moving on to bigger tasks.

🧩 Problem Solving

Practicing regularly on LeetCode and Codeforces to strengthen my DSA foundation and become a better problem solver.

🌱 Looking Ahead

I see amFOSS as more than just a club—it’s a community where I can learn, contribute, and challenge myself to grow. I’m excited to collaborate, take on real projects, and build things that matter.
