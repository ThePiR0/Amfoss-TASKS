# The Final Spell

Congrats ðŸŽ‰. You've successfully decoded the secret code you found out after completing the Terminal Wizard. You've come a long way.  
To mark the end of your hunt for the Championship Cup and to further give the information about Voldemort to Dumbledore, you have to do one last task.  
Clone this repository to your system and checkout the .txt file.  

Take a screenshot of this message and keep it in the "codes" directory that you made earlier.  

Create a *SOLUTION.md* file in your `amfoss-tasks` task directory and write detailed terminal commands which you have used in each step and keep the screenshot you took earlier at the end of the file. Also, write the Git terminal commands that you will use to push all your work to your `amfoss-tasks` GitHub repository.
